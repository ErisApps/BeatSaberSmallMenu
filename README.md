# Small Menu
Makes the main menu smaller & closer, just like it was in Beat Saber 1.13.0. By default, this means scaling the menu down to 1.0 instead of 1.5, but you can also manually adjust the scale from 0.5 to 2.0 in *Options* > *Mod Settings* > *SmallMenu*.

## Comparison
*Before* is the standard menu size as of 1.13.2, and *After* is the size of the menu after installing SmallMenu, which is identical to the size of the menu in version 1.13.0.
